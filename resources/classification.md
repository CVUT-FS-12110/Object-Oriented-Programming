## Aditional information
* You should solve the task assigned by the lecturer every week. If you are unable to solve it within one week, notify the lecturer. The lecturer can grant you extra time to finish the task. However, you can get max. 70 % of points. 
* The correct solution to all tasks during the semester can give you up to 100 points (every task can produce an equal fraction of points from this total number).
* Upload your solution via moodle assignments feataure.
* Your submission has to be python script `.py` runnable by Python 3.x (You can of course use jupyter notebook (files `.ipynb`) for solving the task on your side. When you are finished, you will convert and submit your solution as `.py` file)
* If you use different than distribution packages, provide a requirements file for easy installation of the packages via Pip.
* Your code has to result in the expected output without any modification required from the lecturer (debugging, uncommenting).
* Your code needs to be commented and/or self-explanatory (final word has lecturer)
* Submission of solutions in weird formats (pictures, .txt, binary files) or solutions throwing errors will be considered a bad joke and can result in awarding an unlimited negative number of points.
* A lecturer can also award you with an undefined negative number of points if the lecturer finds your solution not original enough, or malignant in any way (final word has lecturer).
* You should be able to explain and defend your solution to prove that you are the author of the solution. Otherwise, the solution may not be accepted and you can be awarded negative points (the final word has lecturer).
